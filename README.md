Moblie Price Classification 

Mobile price classification involves categorizing mobile phones into different price ranges based on various features and specifications.
This can be approached as a machine learning problem where you train a model to predict the price category of a mobile phone given its features

AWS SageMaker: Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. It provides a set of tools for various stages of the machine learning lifecycle.

Implementation on AWS SageMaker: Implementing XGBoost on AWS SageMaker involves utilizing SageMaker's features for data processing, model training, and model deployment. Here's a general outline of the process: Data Preparation: Upload your dataset to Amazon S3, an object storage service on AWS. SageMaker Script: Write a script (e.g., Python script) that defines the XGBoost model, including hyperparameters and training code. Training Job: Use SageMaker to launch a training job, specifying the XGBoost script and the location of your data in S3. Model Artifacts: After training, SageMaker stores the trained model artifacts in S3. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained XGBoost model as an endpoint, making it accessible for making predictions in real-time.

Benefits: Using AWS SageMaker provides several advantages, such as scalability, managed infrastructure, and simplified deployment. It abstracts away the complexities of setting up and managing the underlying infrastructure, allowing data scientists and developers to focus more on building and deploying models.
